Most shops will be using a mix of Agile and Scrum in their development methodology. I created a cheat sheet for myself to reference; hopefully, it will help others. A pdf of the cheat sheet can be found [here on my GitHub](https://github.com/jakeEspinosa/scrumCheatSheet/).

## General Workflow
1. The Product Owner selects items from the Product Backlog to accomplish in the Sprint.
2. The Product Owner and Developers discuss Product Backlog items in the Sprint Planning meeting.
3. Developers prioritize selected items and create the Sprint Backlog.
4. Sprint Backlog items are assigned to Developers and worked.
5. As the situation changes, the Developers and Product Owner negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog.
6. Scrum Team conducts Sprint Review.
7. Scrum Team conducts Sprint Retrospective to conclude the Sprint.

## Roles
### Developers
* Plan, adapt, and execute the Sprint

### Product Owner
* Manages Product Backlog
* Communicates Product Backlog items to Developers

### Scrum Master
* Leads the Scrum Team in executing Scrum

## Artifacts
### Product Backlog
* Prioritized list of items to add value to the product.

### Sprint Backlog
* Plan containing items from the Product Backlog to accomplish in a Sprint.

### Increment
* Work that meets the Definition of Done produced during a Sprint.

## Definition of Done
A _formal_ description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product (Sutherland & Schwaber, 2020).
