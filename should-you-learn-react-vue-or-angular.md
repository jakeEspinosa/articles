This question puzzles many beginner front-end engineers, but the answer is simpler than you think! In this quick article, we will discuss and give you actionable advice. First, let's start with a quick review of the differences between the three:

## React
Developed by Facebook, React is the least opinionated of the three. It grants the most flexibility and, as a result, the most footguns. Many organizations use it, so jobs are plentiful. It has rich tooling and broad community support due to its overwhelming popularity.

## Angular
Angular is the oldest kid on the block. Coming from Google, it is also the most opinionated of the three. Like React, its tooling is mature and community vast.

## Vue
Vue is the middle road. It is more opinionated than React but less than Angular. It sits somewhere between React and Angular in terms of popularity (at least in my market). Personally, Vue is my favorite, and I write most of my project's front-ends in Vue.

## Which One?
The answer is simple: it doesn't matter. The concepts and core UI skills you'll develop overlap. Pick whichever is more prevalent in your local market. A component is the same in all three, as is reactivity, user flow, etc. We should strive to be engineers who can pick up any framework in a week or two. As such, it will behoove you to master fundamental HTML and CSS before moving on to a UI library.

## Takeaway
Pick the one that is most common in your local market. The skills you'll develop will spill over into the other two.
